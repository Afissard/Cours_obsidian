# Minecraft is the best Turing-Complete games
One of the most famous Turing complete games in history is the so simple to understand but harder to master, (and no I'm not speaking about Dwarf-Fortress), but the mathematical game of Conway : The Conway Game of Life. By creating migrating cells, you can send signals to some logic gates, create memory and in the end, recreate the Conway Game of Life in the Conway Game of Life.

But today we're not talking about Conway genius game's. No today I have the pleasure to introduce you the next generation of Turing complete games : Minecraft. Minecraft is a sandbox game, that allows you to build anything you want, in survival or creative mode. And one of the many features of the vanilla (no community mods) game, is the Redstone. These ressources have some similarity's with real world electronics, and it did not take time for the players, once it was introduced back in ? to try to recreate logic gates and computers. In ? was released to the public, nowadays quite famous map in the tech community : an in-game calculator and it was just the first step to the development of Minecraft in game computers.
Today, in 2023 there is some server running Minecraft computer that are more powerful than the Nasa computer's use to send the first mans on the Moon !

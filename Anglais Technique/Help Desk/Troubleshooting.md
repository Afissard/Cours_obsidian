- for clarification
To find better solutions

# What is troubleshooting
Fix problems
# Exemple of troubleshooting (mum's printer)
## Question to ask
- How long this problem has been going on ?
- any error message ?
- what they were doing / have done -> did they install or update something
- ask for information about the faulty device (brand, model, reference, ...)
- have you try to restart your computer
- did it make weird noise, or weird action (shoot ink) ?
- LED blinking ?
- Ask to send a picture or video, or video chat and in reverse, send picture to show what you are asking for
- Get some external point of view
- make them trust you
## Your mother lies
- misinterpretation
	- she is not an expert
- She is in the wrong state of mind and can't think clearly
- She makes mistakes
- She's over exaggerate the problem so that is looks more important
- Shame / guilt, she suspect that she may have cause the problem
- She may not think it's relevant
## Communication
- ask them in their own word
- define the tech word you are using
- sum up and rephrase
## Your tools
- google : 
	- you know how to make it work
	- you know how to interpret the result
## Fix the issue
- driver problem -> reinstall the latest version
- printer connection (USB) -> check the physical connection
	- seems connected -> is the wire, or port not working -> try change wire or port (cross testing)

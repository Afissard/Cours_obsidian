# 4 Analyze interpret

We can identificate a few factors that may influence these result :
- The first one is geographic : in the developing countries, where the average age of the population is younger, there will be more positive answer from this young population than the elder one.
- The second is more society related : in general, the elder population have more exeperience and lived more thing. This factors will push the oldest to say the world was better before, because of memory distortion but also because nowadays information sources (TV, Radio, etc) tends to cover bad news more than good ones.
We should analyse the situation over a long period of time with the same persons and analyse the evolution of the results, notably by doing some parrallele with event that may influant there answer.

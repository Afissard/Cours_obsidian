Dear Mr Ritt
I am writing in connection with the order I placed with you (ref: UUBBLLRRba). Unfortunately, there seems to be some issue with the delivery : First, the order specified 25 Dell PCs and this does not seem consistant with the 24 we received. In addition, one HP PC seems to be faulty.
I would appreciate if you could look into this as soon as possible.
Best regards,
